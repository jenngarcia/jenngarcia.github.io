    <p id="quote">"Obviously not everyone gets to do what we do or see as much as we do, but the feelings of exhaustion and depression and feeling like you’re burning at both ends—some things you left at home are slipping away from you—being in this band has cost me multiple relationships, some friendships. Although it is the coolest job in the world, you’re not immune to bad feelings. I think we make the songs relatable because we don’t write too specifically. If you write too specifically, no one is really going to relate to it. It’s too much about you. I think everybody can relate to burning at both ends and just feeling worn out. "</p>
